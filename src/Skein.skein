Southern Adventure
An Interactive Fiction by Sylvan Zheng
Release 1 / Serial number 201029 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Hospital Room (in the bed)
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board. 

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

You see a phone, wallet, and keys on the table across the room.

You can also see a tattered novel here.

Grassy Slope
The meadow is peaceful and quiet. The sun, directly ahead, warms your face. In the distance to the west you can make out a small hut.

A deep and raging river runs through to the south. Further, a dark forest looms.

The meadow is peaceful and quiet. The sun, directly ahead, warms your face. In the distance to the west you can make out a small shack.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

A deep and raging river runs through the meadow to the south. Further, a dark forest looms.

You board the train. The conductor walks by, and instead of checking for your ticket merely gives you a friendly smile. You sit down in an empty compartment, which isn't particularly difficult to find. Unperturbed, you settle into your seat as the train clunks into motion.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

You can also see a train door here.

 And saying this, he spurred his horse Rocinante without heeding what his squire Sancho was shouting to him, that he was attacking windmills and not giants. But he was so certain they were giants that he paid no attention to his squire Sancho's shouts, nor did he see what they were, even though he was very close. Rather, he went on shouting: "Do not flee, cowards and vile creatures, for it's just one knight attacking you!"

A grinding screech jolts you out of Cervantes" intricate world. Looking out the window it seems the train has stopped. The conductor has reappeared and has opened the train door.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow.

Hospital Room (in the bed)
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A rickety bridge extends toward the opposite bank. It sways gently into the wind.

saloon
An empty saloon.

Your nurse from the hospital is absentmindedly drying glasses behind the bar. You blink. The bartender looks up at you quizzically and you realize you certainly made a mistake.

Hospital Room (in the bed)
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board.

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

You see a phone, wallet, and keys on the table across the room.

You can also see a bulletin board and a tattered novel here.

traincar
You board the train. The conductor walks by, and instead of checking for your ticket merely gives you a friendly smile. You sit down in an empty compartment, which isn't particularly difficult to find. Unperturbed, you settle into your seat as the train clunks into motion.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

You can also see a train door here.

 And saying this, he spurred his horse Rocinante without heeding what his squire Sancho was shouting to him, that he was attacking windmills and not giants. But he was so certain they were giants that he paid no attention to his squire Sancho's shouts, nor did he see what they were, even though he was very close. Rather, he went on shouting: "Do not flee, cowards and vile creatures, for it's just one knight attacking you!"

A grinding screech jolts you out of Cervantes" intricate world. Looking out the window it seems the train has stopped.

Hospital Room
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board. 

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

You arrive at a small peninsula in the riverbank. An unkempt woman sits on the porch of a small hut, absentmindedly tapping the ground beside her with a blackened fire poker.

A rickety bridge extends toward the opposite bank. It sways gently into the wind.

The hut is small and bare, with only the barest necesseties.

Train
Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

 And saying this, he spurred his horse Rocinante without heeding what his squire Sancho was shouting to him, that he was attacking windmills and not giants. But he was so certain they were giants that he paid no attention to his squire Sancho's shouts, nor did he see what they were, even though he was very close. Rather, he went on shouting: "Do not flee, cowards and vile creatures, for it's just one knight attacking you!":

traincar
You board the train. The conductor walks by, and instead of checking for your ticket merely gives you a friendly smile. You sit down in an empty compartment, which isn't particularly difficult to find. Unperturbed, you settle into your seat as the train clunks into motion.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

Hospital Room
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board. 

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

An unremarkable saloon.

Your nurse from the hospital is absentmindedly drying glasses behind the bar. You blink. The bartender looks up at you quizzically and you realize you certainly made a mistake.

A trio of patrons sit at the far end of the saloon.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

The railroad station is impeccably architected, with a large archway entrance and beautiful iron grated windows.

A cat with a beautiful dark coat of fur purrs gently, curled up on the tiled floor.

The man at the ticket counter seems familiar to you somehow.

 And saying this, he spurred his horse Rocinante without heeding what his squire Sancho was shouting to him, that he was attacking windmills and not giants. But he was so certain they were giants that he paid no attention to his squire Sancho's shouts, nor did he see what they were, even though he was very close. Rather, he went on shouting: "Do not flee, cowards and vile creatures, for it's just one knight attacking you!":

Riverbank
You arrive at a small peninsula in the riverbank. An unkempt woman sits on the porch of a small hut, absentmindedly tapping the ground beside her with a blackened fire poker.

A rickety bridge extends toward the opposite bank. It sways gently into the wind.

The woman pockets the money and guides you across the bridge. As you cross she warns you against stepping on several of the bridge planks, which have led more than one traveler to their deaths. Before long you have lost track of which planks are safe to step on.
 She dances away, leaving you at the edge of the forest.

Dark Forest
The forest hums with the chatter of animal life. The trees cast deep shadows across the undergrowth. A faint trail winds south into the undergrowth.

You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board.

You read: "It seems to me," responded don Quixote, "that you aren't well-versed in adventures-they are giants; and if you're afraid, get away from here and start praying while I go into fierce and unequal battle with them." And saying this, he spurred his horse Rocinante without heeding what his squire Sancho was shouting to him, that he was attacking windmills and not giants. But he was so certain they were giants that he paid no attention to his squire Sancho's shouts, nor did he see what they were, even though he was very close. Rather, he went on shouting: "Do not flee, cowards and vile creatures, for it's just one knight attacking you!"

You feel a slight headache. You put the book down.

dark forest
The forest hums with the chatter of animal life. The trees cast deep shadows across the undergrowth. Further to the south you see a faint orange electric glow.

traincar
You board the train. The conductor walks by, and instead of checking for your ticket merely gives you a friendly smile. You sit down in an empty compartment, which isn't particularly difficult to find. Unperturbed, you settle into your seat as the train clunks into motion.

Looking out the window you see the forest give way to valleys and mountains, and then open plains with the occasional solitary cow. The sun, still yellow in the sky gives clouds a luminance that makes them like appear like marble. The shadow of the railroad car stretches longer and longer toward the horizon, yet the sun remains fixed in the sky, at that golden angle just before dusk. From your seat on the train the country appears both vast and intimate.

You can also see a train door here.

Hospital Room
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board.

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

There is an IV drip next to you.

You are lying in a bed.

You see a phone on the table across the room.

You can also see a wallet, keys, a bulletin board and a tattered novel here.

Hospital Room (in the bed)
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board.

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

You see a phone, wallet, and keys on the table across the room.

You can also see a bulletin board and a tattered novel here.

Hospital Room (in the bed)
You are in what appears to be a hospital room. The walls are bare save for a bulletin board.

A door across the room is slightly ajar. Outside, voices drift softly back and forth.

A cracked window lets in a feeble amount of light.

You see a phone, wallet, and keys on the table across the room.

You can also see a bulletin board and a tattered novel here.
